Ok so this is my blog??? idk man lets test it.

So this is for me. Micah. 

we HAVE to keep index at the root. not in published. ik, its annoying.
we CAN set other homes tho i think maybe
## Todo:
* remove published, keep everything in vault/
	* add publish: true to metadata.
* add lunr.js for search, or ANY other plugin.
	* https://github.com/christian-fei/Simple-Jekyll-Search
* add Edited dates to files somehow?
